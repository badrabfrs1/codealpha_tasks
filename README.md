# CodeAlpha Certification Tasks Repository

This repository stores the completed tasks for the CodeAlpha certification program.

## Tasks :

1. **Titanic Classification**:
   - Implemented a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic dataset using classification algorithms such as Decision Trees or Random Forests. Included preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression**:
   - Developed a linear regression model to predict a target variable based on a set of independent variables. Included data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.

3. **Stock Prediction**:
   - Built a machine learning or deep learning model to predict stock prices based on historical data. Included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using appropriate techniques for time-series forecasting.
